// When working with modern front-end projects using Vite and TypeScript, you
// might come across a file named vite-env.d.ts located in the project root
// or src directory. Although this file doesn't contribute to the final
// output or runtime behavior, it plays a crucial role in improving development
// experience and ensuring type safety.

// vite-env.d.ts is a standard TypeScript declaration file (with the .d.ts
// extension). It is not required by Vite but is a common convention in
// Vite + TypeScript projects. Its primary job is to declare types for
// Vite-specific globals and runtime interfaces (such as import.meta.env) so
// that TypeScript can recognize them and provide proper type support during
// development.

// It's important to note that this file doesn't define or inject any values
// into your application. The actual values for environment variables like
// VITE_API_URL come from your .env files and are injected by Vite during
// the build process. What vite-env.d.ts does is declare what those variables
// are and what types they have, so TypeScript can check and suggest them
// properly.

//Even though you won't see this file listed explicitly in your tsconfig.json,
// TypeScript will automatically include it as long as it's placed in a folder
// that's covered by the include field, such as the root directory or src/. The
// declarations in this file apply globally, so you don't need to import it
// anywhere for it to work.

/// <reference types="vite/client" />
// In Vite + TypeScript project, you might see this line at the top of a
// vite-env.d.ts file. This is a special TypeScript syntax called triple-slash
// directive, used to include type definitions.

// This directive tells the TypeScript compiler to load the type declarations
// from the vite/client module. These types are provided by the Vite package (
// installed in node_modules) and include support for global Vite features like
// import.meta.env and import.meta.hot.

// Unlike standard import statements, triple-slash directives are used only
// for type inclusion, not for importing runtime code. That means they won't
// add anything to your build output - they simply enhance the development
// experience with better type checking and editor support.

interface ImportMetaEnv {
  VITE_db_username: string;
}
// Environment variables are essential for configuring how a Vue project built
// with Vite behaves across different environments (development or production).
// They allow you to separate configuration from code, making your application
// more secure, maintainable, and flexible.

// Vite includes several built-in environment variables that are automatically
// injected at build time. These provide useful information such as the
// current mode and base path, and are available through the import.meta.env
// object.

// To define custom environment variables that are accessible in the frontend,
// they must be prefixed with VITE_. This is a security measure to ensure that
// only explicitly intended variables are exposed to your application.

// You can define environment variables in various ways, including dedicated
// environment files, shell scripts, or directly in the development environment.
// While multiple methods exist, using environment files is the most common and
// consistent approach across teams and tools.

// When working in teams, it's important to handle environment variables
// carefully. Sensitive variables should not be committed to version control,
// and shared scripts or documentation should clearly indicate the required
// variables. This ensures security and consistency across development setups.

// TypeScript, by default, does not recognize custom environment variables, so
// it's necessary to declare them explicitly to benefit from type checking and
// auto-completion. This is usually done in a global declaration file such as
// vite-env.d.ts.
